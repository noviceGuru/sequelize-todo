# Project definition
This project is an exercise to create APIs which enables our front-end to create, delete, read and modify user's credentials and information, and also creates a todo list related to each user, with the same abilities.
It uses SQlite (a relational database) as DB and sequelize as ORM. I used `TypeScript` and used `Node watch mode` directly, without using extra libraries.

# To Run the Dev Server
To start the development server, run the `startDevServer.sh` script file in the root directory, simply by
`bash startDevServer.sh` .
